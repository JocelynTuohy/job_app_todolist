Welcome to my to-do list demo!

This project was created by me, Jocelyn Tuohy, on 12/1/2017 using Django 1.11.2. I used Python 2.7.12, but kept Python 3's requirements in mind so the code should mostly be forward-compatible. I did my work in Visual Studio Code.
I recommend you have Python 2.7, pip, and virtualenv installed to have the easiest time running this. Styling was kept to a minimum as the purpose of this was to demonstrate my Python abilities.

In order to install the correct dependencies using pip:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to where requirements.txt is located using your favorite terminal.
3. Create a new virtual environment using your tool of choice (like virtualenv).
4. Run the following in your command line: pip install -r requirements.txt
5. If Python 2 is your default, run the following from the root folder: python manage.py runserver
   (replace "python" with "python2" if Python 3 is your default)
6. Open localhost:/8000 in your favorite browser (developed using Google Chrome).
